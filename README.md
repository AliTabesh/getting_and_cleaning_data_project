## Files

"Code Book.Rmd" a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

"run_analysis.R" performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:

1.	Merges the train and the test dataset to shape a unique dataset
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5.	Creates a second tidy data set from previous steps with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 


"final_data.txt" is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
